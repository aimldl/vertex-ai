## Vertex AI: Classic ML + Generative AI
Vertex AI is an end-to-end platform designed to streamline the building and deployment of machine learning models.  With the rise of generative AI, exemplified by OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google has integrated its own generative AI capabilities into Vertex AI.  Consequently, Vertex AI has evolved into a comprehensive platform supporting both traditional machine learning and generative AI.

## Useful Resource: Official Documentation
* Vertex AI > Doc. > [Vertex AI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs)
Google Cloud's official documents are the recommended source to learn about Vertex AI. I often encountered the unofficial guides are out-dated. This document is not an exception. The official doc contains the up-to-date "official" content which is comprehensive and well-maintaned by Google Cloud. 

As of now, the table of content of the Vertex AI official doc is: 
  - Get started with GenAI
  - Get started with Vertex AI
  - Train your own ML model
  - Manage your workflow
  - Tutorials and samples
  - Resources

This doc also includes:
- Latest Videos and 
- the list of Vertex AI and Cloud ML products.

The plethora of information provided by the doc is both blessing and curse. Undoubtedly, it is a useful resource serving as the single source of truth. Unfornately for a beginner, there are some hurdles to use Vertex AI even thought there are several "Getting started documents" for many sub-topics.

## Useful Resource: Books
There are several books in the topic of Vertex AI.
